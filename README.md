DEAR CREATORS

WELCOME:
--------
thank you for choosing this tools and welcome  
this code is for me,my vrc friends and all public users on the net as well

PURPOSE:
--------
this script is made to easy object placements  
so the creator will easily orient and focus his self to object positioning

INSTALLATION:
-------------
import script from "TOOLS" to your Assets folder

INSTRUCTION:
------------
-create some object in hierarchy  
-then create a plane or any kind of ground  
-use that first or any other newly created objects  
-and try to place on the ground  
-you will see what will happen when you hover over the ground  
-upon script removal all ground checker components will be removed from hierarchy objects

COMPATIBILITY:
--------------
UNITY/VRCHAT please know ... if you wanna upload your creations to the vrchat,  
there will be a possibility that unity will give you some errors that will prevent ongoing upload.  
in that case ... just remove ground checker script from your asset folder  
and one more thing ... vrchat will not upload custom "unsupported" script to the vrchat  
because it will automatically exclude unsupported script from your upload  
so you don't have to worry about it.

HINT:
-----
-did you know that you can temporarily modify selected object's ground checker component  
-you can also select and lift multiple objects above ground and see their visual placement locations as well
